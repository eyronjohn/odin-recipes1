        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. It's popular comfort food in the Philippines,  usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim),</li>
            <li>Tomatoes- use ripe, juicy tomatoes</li>
            <li>Onion-peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>Fish sauce- brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer</li>
            <li>Gabi- adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth</li>
            <li>Radish (labanos)</li>
            <li>Vegetables- the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, b</li>
            <li>Tamarind- can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes</li>
            <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash tamarind pods under cold, running water to remove any grit or dirt from the skins.
            </li>
            <li>Place in a saucepan with about 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until soft, and the outer skins begin to burst.</li>
            <li>Using a fork, mash the tamarinds to release the pulp</li>
            <li>Place the tamarind and liquid in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice to fully extract the juice.   </li>
            <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.</li>
