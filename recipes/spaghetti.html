        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Filipino Spaghetti is the Pinoy version of Spaghetti with meat sauce. This version has a sweet tomato based sauce with lots of meat ingredients such as ground pork, luncheon meat, and hotdogs.</p>
        <p>This Filipino spaghetti version makes use of store-bought Filipino Style spaghetti sauce (this is also sometimes labeled as Filipino Style Tomato Sauce), instead of making one from scratch. I think that the sauce that I used was good because it has the flavors that I was expecting. It also helped me saved a little time because I do not need to make my Filipino Spaghetti Sauce from ground-up. We also have another version which I called Pinoy Spaghetti.</p>
